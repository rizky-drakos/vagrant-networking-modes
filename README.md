<h3>A good example shows this best</h3>
<p>
  Speaking of VirtualBox networking modes there are 8 of them, but we will be only focusing on 
  <a href=>NAT</a>, <a href=>Bridged networking</a>, <a href=>Internal networking</a> and 
  <a href=>Host-only networking</a>. And Vagrant, with its VirtualBox provider, is ultilized to 
  create all necessary playgrounds for this purpose.
